# MPU9250-9axis
Getting reliable pitch, roll, yaw angles from raw data of a 9-axis IMU sensor.

I'm using the MPU9250 sensor, which includes a 3-axis accelerometer, a 3-axis gyroscope, and a 3-axis magnetometer. For sensor fusion, I implemented an Adaptive Kalman Filter. The project is built on an ESP32 microcontroller.

To be continued...
